the login failed part at the end is how hydra knows if it worked or not, should match what the website responds with

# exploit
use 46353.cs
change values and do what it says and get shell 
go to http://10.10.99.216/?theme=../../App_Data/files to get callback after upload as PostView.ascx

# enumerate
use systeminfo to get info and pluyg into windows-exploit-suggester
Nothing there that I can use really. - maybe this: cat /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/windows/local/37049.txt
Tried that, didn't work or do anything =/ does it work if I'm on MSF? GOt some weird errors on that too. 
Uploaded and ran winPEAS
* could use psexec probably since winpeas has a password thatmight work? 


#excalate
Has something to do with the scheduler, not sure what exe they're looking for
Can see that it's autorunning and everyone can run it. 
See that systemscheduler has event logs that show message.exe is restarting a lot
overwrite with exe and get shell
Could have used one of the things exploit suggested I would just have to compile them to get different functionality.
