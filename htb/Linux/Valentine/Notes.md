# Enumerate

Notes got trashed because kali isn't stable and everything froze

Here's the summary. 

* found heartbleed exploit that works
* Found the url with the data in the data
* put that string into decoder and got a string
* found a url with a rsa key in hex that had a password on it
* used information disclosure to test that 'hype' was user
* used key and password to ssh in
* tried the kernel exploit, didn't work. Maybe reset and compile it on the box. 
* Also didn't work, I guess that's just a POC that doesn't have any actual exploit code. 
* Tried a few of the linuxprivchecker listed kernel exploits but nothing working? Am I on the right track? 
  * Nope
* Looked through privesc scripts more. Found the tmux thing.
